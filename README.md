# Machine Learning projects

This repository contains Data science projects that I have completed during the first weeks at [Spiced Academy Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en). The projects cover data analysis and vizualisation, feature engineering, application of different Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, ARIMA), hyperparameter optimzation and regularization, natural languge processing and time series analysis.

## Gapminder - Visual data analysis 
* Data: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* Goal: creating and animated scatterplot
* Descriptive statistics, plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Titanic - 
* Data: [Titanic-Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
* Goal: applying a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic
* Exploring the Titanic dataset and building a baseline model
* Training a Logistic Regression and Random Forest classification models
* Creating features using one-hot encoding
* Calculating the train and test accuracy and cross-validation score
