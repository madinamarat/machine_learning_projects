I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go I fell in love at the seaside I handled my charm with time and slight of hand  Do you want to go to the seaside? I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go I fell in love at the seaside She handled her charm with time and slight of hand, and oh  But I'm just trying to love you In any kind of way But I find it hard to love you girl When you're far away Away  Do you want to go to the seaside?

When you never asked for nothing at all Even afterwards cluttered your door And you do your best to fold me and unfold me again  And unfold me again  And it gets to me, gets to me Tell me the meaning of life is To be happy and to give up loss But you've never lost something you loved But I turn around How could I be angry at you?

And no one would notice Nobody noticed That it's me, where it began And I pray for forgiveness within  I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me I think of every little stupid mistake that is made This time I'll have the strength to gather myself I'm falling to pieces  And I pray for forgiveness Look for the answer Cause it's hard for me to pretend Look to my mother Call to the captain Can't you see This state that I'm in Pray for forgiveness Looking for justice Searching for answers Call to my mother Pray for forgiveness Breaking the silence  Nobody knows it, nobody noticed That's it me Where it began"

Alicia Keys,"Childhood living is easy to do  The things you wanted I bought them for you  Graceless lady you know who I am  You know I can't let you slide through my hands   Wild horses couldn't drag me away  Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away   I watched you suffer a dull aching pain  Now you decided to show me the same  No sweeping exits or offstage lines  Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind   Wild horses couldn't drag me away  Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away   I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie  I have my freedom but I don't have much time  Faith has been broken, tears must be cried  Let's do some living before we die   Wild horses couldn't drag me away  Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day   Wild horses couldn't drag me away  Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day"
Alicia Keys,Remembering the days when our love began Thinkin' of a million ways  To escape and be with you But reality wasn't just you and I It was long drawn out days and lonely nights  Dreamin' bout you  I keep dreamin' bout you When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say  [Chorus] Let me take you to another place Where nothing ever seems to matter Its just you and me We can take flight like a thief in the night Stolen moments with you (oh oh)  Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan) I was just a girl and you a young man How could age define Something so divine (so divine) Can this even be real or just exist in my mind  Dreamin' bout you  I keep dreamin' 'bout you When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say  [Chorus]  Dreamin' bout you  I keep dreamin' bout you When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day When no one and nothing else takes up our time Finally you're only mine  Each and everyday I don't walk with you right by my side But instead we have to hide Sneak around and lie  Just to spend time alone This lovin is a crime  I'd rather do the time And leave the world behind  [Chorus]  Let's get away  Let's get away Oh oh  We can get away  We can get away Oh oh  Let's get away  Let's get away Oh oh  We can get away  We can get away Oh oh

Alicia Keys,"Here I am, here we are As it will go on forever Noise, always noise Candles burn, lights are low I haven't a place to go  Life in it's constant state of moving nowhere The music is nice, floats through the air Sounds of waves crashing everywhere Percussive submissions, mind conditions Writing with the left hand Unknowing and taking the chance  Why not fly? Why not try? This constant game I play to stay high But all is just a state of mind All is reality of your choice Constant evolution, constant adaptation Constant state of moving nowhere  Footsteps, silence is loud Kindness is brave, wisdom is long Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it Searching, looking for the satisfaction It is nowhere, it is everywhere  Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come What are we waiting for? Why are we so afraid of taking charge? But it's always changing, always In the constant state of going nowhere  We all have demons to battle, roads to walk Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins Candles and their steady glow Water and its constant crash  Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone Still strong, still here and so are we Here we are forever The constant state of going nowhere  The constant state of going nowhere Constant state of going nowhere Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere Constant state of moving nowhere  It's like a jungle It's like a jungle  It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death Always feels like a race against father time In the streets of New York  All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time In the streets of New York  New York, New York, New York New York, New York City New York, New York, New York New York, New York City  New York, New York, New York New York, New York City New York, New York, New York New York, New York City  In the, in the city In the, in the city New York, New York City In the, in the city In the, in the city  In the, in the city New York, New York City In the, in the city In the, in the city  In the, in the city New York, New York City In the, in the city In the, in the city"
